<p><strong>ImaADPCM</strong> stands for International Multimedia Association (IMA) Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM). 
It is a lossy compression mechanism that compresses data recorded at various sampling rates. 
The compression ratio obtained is relatively modest, but it is very fast to encode and decode.

<p><strong>Speex</strong> is an Open Source/Free Software patent-free (part of the GNU Project) audio compression format designed for speech. 
Speex is well-adapted to Internet applications and provides useful features that are not present in most other codecs.
The design goals have been to make a codec that would be optimized for high quality speech and low bit rate.
